<h2>The Big 3</h2>

<h3>Talladega Nights</h3>
<p>This is one of my all time favorites. This is a movie that I can watch at any time and get a good laugh.</p>
<h3>Next Friday</h3>
<p>This movie is a staple in the black community. I laugh hysterically at this movie every time that I see it, it doesnt matter how many times I have seen the movie. I can litterally recite this move word for word when watching</p>
<h3>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</h3>
<p>I grew up loving this movie as a kid and as an adult, I still watch this movie in awe as if I were a kid again.</p>
